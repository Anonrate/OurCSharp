# OurCSharp
It's of Our Creation.

# Description
OurCSharp is project that I have obviously created in C# and it's target is to help people learn to program in C#, and to have a wide variety of libraries to use with your projects whether they may be:
  Custom Controls because you don't like the way Widnows looks or just want something new,
  Custom Form because you want your application to be different from the rest and as of you want it,
  Extensions such as:
    Calculations,
    Conversions,
    Maniuplators,
    Parsers,
    and more;
  Utilites to make your coding life a hell a lot more easier and efficient.

OurCSharp is going to contain usful tools such as:
  Audio Encoders,
  Bitrate Calculators,
  Video Encoders,
  De/Multiplexors;

The OurCSharp project is going to be limitless and endeless because it's "Ours".

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is merely educational and simply if you want to Help or Contribute to a project even if you have little to no knowledge at all of how to code.  There are plenty of other ways you can Help or Contribute.  This project is not like the others where you have to be "Extremely" good at coding to be part of, no.  As said this project is educational meaning if you want to learn, download a copy of the code, tinker with it and see what it does and change it or do what ever you need to to understand how it works.  If you have questions, feel free to ask any of us and we will be glad to help and assist you.

In short, the Purpose or Target of this project is "Everyone"

# Ideas?
Do you have any ideas such as any tools, lib, application, class or anything that want to be added?  Just let us know!  Tell us all of your ideas and what you think should be added to this project.  We are always looking for new imporvements.  If you're idea makes it in, you will be credited for it.  No one is going to take credit for your work except you.  If it's your idea, you will be credited that it was and because of you that idea exists in the project.

# QA
Q:  What Framework does OurCSharp run on?
A:  It runs on and would like it to continue to run on version 4.6.1 which as of now is the latest stable version.  If a new stable version does come to be relased, the project will be updated (Or upgraded depending on the release) accoridingly to the version.

# Want to help?
We are always looking for helpers that can update the documentations and the Wiki as well as find and answer new questions.  If you think you would be able to do that, feel free to inform us and we will give you a shot!
